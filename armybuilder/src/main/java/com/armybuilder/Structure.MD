#### USMC Army Builder - this website will visualize how big the Marine Corp Structure really is with the use of distinct symbols. For example, dots representing each marine, square representing squads, and so forth. Everything will be randomly generated so that unit creation is more realistic. Each marine will provide details as well for their role and weapon equipped.
